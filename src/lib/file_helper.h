/*
    # Open file
    Tries to open the specified file in path and returns the associated stream.
    It iÅŸ a wrapper around the fopen function that checks for an error.

    ## Input
    path -> path to the file to open;
    access_mode -> "r" read, "w" truncate and write, "a" append; using a plus adds the remaining access mode (e.g "r+" read-write)
    calling_func -> name of the calling function, so that if an error occurs it will state the function trying to open the file 
        (set to NULL to omit).

    ## Returns
    The file pointer to the stream associated with the opened file

    ## Input modification
    The 'calling_func' length is stripped after 70 characters to make the copy of the value safe.

    ## Error
    If an error occurs while opening the file this function will exit the program with an error message.
